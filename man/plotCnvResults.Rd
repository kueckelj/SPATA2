\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{SPATA2}.}

\item{across}{Character value or NULL. Specifies the grouping variable of interest.

Use \code{getGroupingOptions()} to obtain all variable names that group the
barcode spots of your object in a certain manner.}

\item{across_subset}{Character vector or NULL. Specifies the particular groups
of interest the grouping variable specified in argument \code{across} contains.

If set to NULL all of them are chosen. You can prefix groups you are NOT interested in
with a \emph{'-'}. (Saves writing if there are more groups you are interested in
than groups you are not interested in.)

Use \code{getGroupNames()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{relevel}{Logical value. If set to TRUE the input order of \code{across_subset}
determines the order in which the groups of interest are displayed. Groups that
are not included are dropped which affects the colors with which they are displayed.}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. Name of the function with which to summarize.}

\item{linesize}{Numeric value. The size of the line(s) plotted.}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing.
Given to argument \code{span} of \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{vline_alpha, vline_color, vline_size, vline_type}{Parameters given to
\code{ggplot2::geom_vline()} that control the appearance of vertical lines
of the plot.}

\item{nrow, ncol}{Numeric values or NULL. Used to arrange multiple plots.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot-object that can be additionally customized according
to the rules of the ggplot2-framework.
}
\description{
Displays a smoothed lineplot indicating
chromosomal gains and losses. Requires the results of \code{runCnvAnalysis()}.
