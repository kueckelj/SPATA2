\arguments{
<<<<<<< HEAD
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{SPATA2}} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{var_names}{Optional. A character vector specifying the names of metadata variables to include in the output.
If \code{NULL}, only the original and aggregated barcodes are returned.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the original barcodes (\code{barcodes_orig}),
the corresponding aggregated barcodes (\code{barcodes_aggr}), and any additional
metadata variables specified in \code{var_names}.
}
\description{
Map aggregated to pre-aggregated barcodes
}
\details{
This function reconstructs the original barcodes before the aggregation
process was applied. It retrieves the pre-aggregation state of the data and,
if specified, adds selected metadata variables.

\item{object}{A \code{SPATA2} object containing spatial transcriptomics data, which has undergone an aggregation process.}

\item{var_names}{Optional. A character vector specifying the names of metadata variables to include in the output. If \code{NULL}, only the original and aggregated barcodes are returned.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the original barcodes (\code{barcodes_orig}), the corresponding aggregated barcodes (\code{barcodes_aggr}), and any additional metadata variables specified in \code{var_names}.

This function reconstructs the original barcodes before the aggregation process was applied. It retrieves the pre-aggregation state of the data and, if specified, adds selected metadata variables.
}
\details{
The \code{unwindAggregation} function is used to reverse the effects of an aggregation process applied to a \code{SPATA2} object. It reconstructs the original barcodes that were aggregated into larger units, allowing the user to recover the pre-aggregation state. If additional metadata variables are specified via \code{var_names}, these variables are included in the output data frame.

This function is particularly useful for tracing back the original barcodes and their associated data after performing a resolution reduction or other aggregation-based operations.

\dontrun{
# Assuming 'object' is a SPATA2 object that has undergone aggregation
original_barcodes <- unwindAggregation(object)

# Retrieve original barcodes with additional metadata
original_barcodes_with_meta <- unwindAggregation(object, var_names = c("cluster", "sample"))
