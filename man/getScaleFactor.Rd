\title{Obtain scale factors}
\usage{
getScaleFactor(object, ...)

\S4method{getScaleFactor}{ANY}(object, fct_name, img_name = NULL)

\S4method{getScaleFactor}{HistoImage}(object, fct_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}

\item{fct_name}{Character value. Name of the scale factor.}

\item{img_name}{Character value. The name of the \code{HistoImage} of interest.
If \code{NULL}, the active histo image is chosen by default.}
}
\value{
Single value whose properties depend on \code{fct_name}.
}
\description{
Extracts scale factors. See details for more.
}
\details{
This function gives access to slot @scale_factors of each registered \code{\link{HistoImage}}.
As it is a list it can be flexibly expanded. The following scale factor slots are
reserved:

\itemize{
\item{\emph{coords}:}{ The coordinate scale factor used to create variables \emph{x} and \emph{y} from
variables \emph{x_orig} and \emph{y_orig} in the coordinates data.frame and the outline data.frames
of the spatial annotations and the tissue. The scale factor depends on the deviation in
resolution from the original image - based on which the coordinates data.frame
was created - and the image picked in \code{img_name} which defaults to to the active
image. If the active image is the original image, this scale factor is 1.}
\item{\emph{pixel}:}{ The pixel scale factor is used to convert pixel values into SI units.
It should have an attribute called "unit" conforming to the format "SI-unit/px}
}
}
