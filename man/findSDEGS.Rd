\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{id}{Character value. The image annotation of interest.}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
image annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{n_bins_circle}{Numeric value or vector of length 2. Specifies how many times the area is buffered with the value
denoted in \code{binwidth}.
(See details for more.)}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the circular bins to which
the barcode-spots are assigned. We recommend to set it equal to the center-center
distance: \code{binwidth = getCCD(object)}. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the image annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{method_de}{Character value. Denotes the method to according to which the de-analysis is performed.
Given to argument \code{test.use} of the \code{Seurat::FindAllMarkers()}-function. Run \code{SPATA::dea_methods}
to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}
}
\value{
An S4 object of class \code{SDEGS}.
}
\description{
Identifies spatially differentially expressed genes (SDEGs) as
suggested by \emph{Zeng et al. (2023)}.
