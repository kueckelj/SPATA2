\usage{
plotMosaicplot(object, grouping, fill_by, clrp = NULL, clrp_adjust = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{SPATA2}} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{grouping}{Character value. The grouping variable that is
plotted on the x-axis.}

\item{fill_by}{Character value. The grouping variable that is used to
fill the mosaic.}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments given to \code{ggmosaic::geom_mosaic()}}
