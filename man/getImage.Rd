\usage{
getImage(object, xrange = NULL, yrange = NULL, expand = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{SPATA2}.}

\item{xrange, yrange}{Vectors of length two or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL},
specifies the x- and y-range to which the output image is cropped. E.g.
\code{xrange = c(200, 500)} results in the image being cropped from
x-coordinate 200 up to x-coordinate 500.

This argument works within the \code{SPATA2} distance framework.
If values are specified in European units of length the input is
immediately converted to pixel units.

See details section of \code{?is_dist} for more information.}

\item{expand}{Vector of length one or two. Specifies the extent to which the  x- and y-span
of the cropped image section is expanded. There are two options to provide values:

Values from 0 to 1 are used to calculate the corresponding percentage of the image
span which is then \bold{added} to it. E.g. \code{expand} = 1 doubles the span,
\code{expand} = 0.5 results in 150 percent of the span and \code{expand} = 0 returns the
original span.

Values bigger than 1 are considered to be absolute values. The returned image
section has the exact x- and y- spans as specified in \code{expand}.
E.g. \code{expand} = 200 results in an image section with x- and y-span of
200. If the input value is bigger than 1 it must be at least as big as the
original span of the image annotation.

To adjust x- and y-span specifically you can provide a vector of length 2.
If you do so the first value is taken to adjust the x-span and the second
value is used to adjust the y-span E.g. \code{expand} = c(0.5, 0) adds 50 percent
of the original x-span to the x-span of the image section and does not adjust
the y-span.

This argument works within the \code{SPATA2} distance framework.
If values are specified in European units of length the input is
immediately converted to pixel units.

See details section of \code{?is_dist} for more information.}
