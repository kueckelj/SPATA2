\title{Add polygons of annotated structures}
\usage{
ggpLayerImageAnnotation(
  object = "object",
  ids = NULL,
  tags = NULL,
  test = "any",
  alpha = 0.5,
  fill = NA,
  linecolor = "black",
  linesize = 1.5,
  linetype = "solid",
  display_color = FALSE,
  clrp = NULL,
  clrp_adjust = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha, size}{Numeric values. Given to \code{ggplot2::geom_polygon()}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments given to \code{scale_color_add_on()}. Used to
set the color adjustments of the polygon (fill and color).}
}
\value{
\code{ggpLayer*()}-functions return lists of \code{ggproto} objects
that can be added to ggplots via the \code{+} operator. In most of the cases
they are supposed to be added to plots created with the \code{plotSurface*()}
family.
}
\description{
Adds ggplot2 layer of polygons of structures that were annotated within the image
with \code{createImageAnnotations()}.
}
\details{
How to use arguments \code{tags} and \code{test} to specify
the image annotations of interest: Input for argument \code{tags} specifies the tags of interest.
Argument \code{test} decides about how the specified tags are used to select
the image annotations of interest. There are multiple options:
\enumerate{
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'any'} or \emph{1}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with at least one of the input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'all'} or \emph{2}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can contain tags that are not specified.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'identical'} or \emph{3}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can not be tagged with anything else.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{not_identical} or \emph{4}: To be included, an image
annotation must \strong{not} be tagged with the combination of input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'none'} or \emph{5}: To be included, an image annotation
must \strong{not} contain any of the input tags.
}

Note that the filtering process happens in addition to / after the filtering by input for argument
\code{ids}.
}
\note{
Adds two additional layers to set the scales for the color- and
fill aesthetic of the plot.
